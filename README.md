# HeliBoard: Terminal-Focused and coding Layout

I built this because most mobile keyboards are a nightmare for coding. They either bury the keys you need under three menus or clutter the screen with stuff you'll never touch.

### Main layout

I’ve capped almost every key at **3 symbols max**. No more sliding through a dozen symbols to find a backtick.

* **Top Row (The "Essentials"):**
* `"` → `'` and `
* `:` → `.` `,` `;`
* `*` → `^` `>` `<`
* `-` → `=` `+` `%`
* `(` → `{` `[`
* `)` → `}` `]`
* `/` → `\` `|`
* `~` → `#` `@`

* **F keys:** `F1`-`F12` are mapped as popups on the top two rows of letters (from `q` to `s`).
* **Functional Row:** I had to sacrifice `.` and `,` to fit `ctrl`, `tab`, `alt`, and `esc` on the functional keys which made the spacebar really short (sorry).

### 6x6 Numpad (calculator-inspired layout)

`(` `)` `{` `}` `[` `]`

`$` `7` `8` `9` `/` `delete`

`%` `4` `5` `6` `*` `spacebar`

`#` `1` `2` `3` `-` `:`

`&` `0` `.` `=` `+` `!`

`abc` `~` `^` `<` `>` `enter`

### Files

You can grab the individual modules to customize your setup (you have to use the first three together in this setup!):

* **Main:** The letter keys, F1-F12 + symbols row.
* **Functional:** The `ctrl/alt/tab/esc` row.
* **Numpad:** The 6x6 grid.
* **Extras:** Simple custom rows for clipboard and emojis.
